# Data Portfolio

This is my portfolio designed to display the visualization metrics for the Top UK YouTubers in 2024.

This is a demo project for a marketing company, ABC Sales, looking to run advertisement campaigns for a product with 2024's top YouTubers in the UK. 

## OBJECTIVE 
To run a successful marketing campaigns with the top YouTubers in the UK.

## CHALLENGES
Struggled to find the right information from: the internet, 3rd party providers, and the BI reporting team.

## SOLUTION
To create a simple dashboard that displays the top YouTubers in the UK by: subscribers, video uploads and views.

## PROJECT PIPELINE ARCHITECTURE
- The dataset was gotten from Kaggle.
- This dataset was then pushed to the SQL server for cleaning, transformation, and testing (data quality checks).
- After the quality checks were done, the cleaned data was pushed to PowerBI to build the dashboard and visualize the data. Analysis of the data will be done here to form our recommendations.

## PROJECT STAGES
- Get the user requirements (i.e. key objective of the user, what does success look like to them, what they want to achieve, what is stressing them at the moment, and what they need from me). The user story is usually included in this.
- Design the dashboard. What information does the user need access to, to get their expected outcome? What data do we need to create to get the information?
- Collect data from the source (client or web source).
- Exploring the data and its content. Scanning the file to check the fields, contents, records, and data properties. Check for errors and inconsistenties.
- Cleaning and transforming the data.
- Test the data the ensure there are no issues with the transformed data.
- Visualize the data in PowerBI.
- Analyze the data to see what options we can recommend to the User based on the insights drawn.
- Justify the recommendation by outlining the thought process and data used to support it then record the findings into a document.
